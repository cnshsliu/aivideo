This is a test document for translation.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test the DOCX processing functionality.

The system should:
1. Extract text from this DOCX file
2. Translate the content using the LLM agent
3. Generate a new DOCX file with the translated content
4. Preserve the paragraph structure

Let's see if this works properly!

End of test document.
