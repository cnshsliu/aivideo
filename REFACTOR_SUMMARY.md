# Refactoring Summary: videoGenerator.py

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Subtitle Processing Functions
The following subtitle processing functions were removed from `videoGenerator.py` as they were moved to `llm_module.py`:

- `_optimize_subtitles`
- `_clean_and_validate_subtitle`
- `_remove_trailing_period`
- `_needs_splitting`
- `_split_long_subtitle`
- `_should_split_subtitle`
- `_split_subtitle`

### 2. Updated `generate_subtitles` Method
The `generate_subtitles` method was simplified to properly call the LLMManager:

```python
def generate_subtitles(self):
    """Generate subtitles using LLM"""
    self.logger.info("Generating subtitles using LLM...")
    
    # Use LLMManager to generate subtitles
    self.voice_subtitles, self.display_subtitles = self.llm_manager.generate_subtitles(
        self.args, self.prompt_folder, self.subtitle_folder, self.logger
    )
    
    # Use display subtitles for the main workflow (backward compatibility)
    self.subtitles = self.display_subtitles
    self._log_subtitles("LLM - Generated")
    
    return True
```

### 3. Updated Methods That Load Existing Subtitles
Methods that load existing subtitles were updated to not use the removed optimization functions:

- `load_existing_subtitles`
- `load_text_file_subtitles`
- `load_static_subtitles`

These methods now use the same subtitles for both voice and display instead of optimizing them.

### 4. Maintained Necessary Functions
The following functions were kept in `videoGenerator.py` as they are still needed:

- `_log_subtitles` - For logging subtitles
- `_create_display_voice_mapping` - For mapping display to voice subtitles
- `_calculate_subtitle_timestamps` - For calculating subtitle timing
- `_create_srt_subtitle_file` - For creating SRT files
- `_add_subtitles_fallback` - For fallback subtitle addition

### 5. Imports
All necessary imports were maintained. Some imports from `utils_module` that were only used by the removed functions are still kept because they are used by other parts of the code:

- `calculate_safe_max_chars`
- `split_long_subtitle_text`

Other imports from `utils_module` that were only used by the removed functions were not removed to avoid potential issues, but they could be removed in a future cleanup if they are not used elsewhere.

### 6. No Circular Import Issues
The refactoring did not introduce any circular import issues. The imports are properly structured:

- `videoGenerator.py` imports from `config_module.py`
- `videoGenerator.py` imports from `llm_module.py`
- `videoGenerator.py` imports from `utils_module.py`

None of these modules import from `videoGenerator.py`, so there are no circular dependencies.

## Verification
The refactored code was verified to:
1. Remove all subtitle processing functions that were moved to `llm_module.py`
2. Ensure all necessary imports are in place
3. Make sure the `generate_subtitles` method properly calls the LLMManager
4. Fix any circular import issues (none were found)
