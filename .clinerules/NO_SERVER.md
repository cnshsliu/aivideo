always use pnpm instead of npm
Do NOT run pnpm run dev for Testing, the server is already running outside of vscode at http://localhost:5173, access it for testing 
When use browser tool for testing, Open https://localhost:5173, click login first, enter username 'demo' and password 'demo123', submit the login form, then navigate to any functions
